<h1>BCRP IS COOMING SOON!</h1>
<p>
<strong>Black City Roleplay</strong> is a fun community on <strong>Roblox</strong>. We are a well organised discord server. Our staff will try their best to help you in any way they can.<br>They also read all suggestions and tickets made on the <strong>Discord</strong>.
<br> We strive for excellence, and professionalism. We were once the biggest server in ER:LC, having about well over 2300 members, however the older server was shut down due to some complications.
<br> Black City was restarted by 3GHXXT in late 2021, and had 700 members before shutting down and restarting in November of 2021, and now, we are here.
<br> We have well over 1000 members in just a few weeks time. Everyone in the staff team is grateful and we are looking to grow further.
